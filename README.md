# Template

Basic android app using the following libraries:

- [dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- [retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
- [parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler)
- [butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)
- [glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
- [spoon](https://github.com/square/spoon)
- [spoon-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin)

It also showcases the use of `Component`, `Subcomponent`, `Scope` and how to run all those libraries combined in POJO and UI test, with module override, mock APIs, API errors etc.

PR and suggestions highly appreciated!
